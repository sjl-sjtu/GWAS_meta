# GWAS_meta
This package provids three methods to get optimal ABF of single SNP and a phenotype in Bayesian GWAS meta-analysis including Subset-Exhaustive, MCMC and shotgun stochastic search. 

Install the package as the following:
```R
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("sjl-sjtu/GWAS_meta")
```
This package is modified based on the Bayesian meta-analysis package "metabf" which is available at https://github.com/trochet/metabf. We appreciate the authors' work and details about the original edition can be found at [[1]](#rf1).

## Software
An web tool to conduct GWAS meta-analysis using SMetABF is developed based on R Shiny. You can use the tool at https://sunjianle-sjtu.shinyapps.io/analycode/. Please uplaod your file according to the example format. The example data can be found at the folder .
